I believe you that you raise your sister. 

Your mother is working to feed you. But providing for you financially does not make her a good mother. It only means, she most likely left you home alone with your sister and had no time to care for the both of you. She is maybe having a job she hates and you are getting her anger when she is at home.

Just a guess. I am sorry for your whole family. My parents also struggled financially &amp; mentally. The responsibilities switched because of this. I am the one giving relationship advices to my mother, help her to apply for jobs, helped my parents financially when I was older, I am the one cooking when I visit my mother/she visits me. My parents did their best to raise us. My father worked a lot. But he  screamed, insulted &amp; punished or ignored us when he was home. 

My brother told me a few days ago, how his boss&amp;wife invited him and cooked for him. He was so happy, that they hugged him to say goodbye and it felt so good and he would wish our father would have ever done something like this. 

So you aren't AH. Try your best to have good grades &amp; get a good job. We earned our pocket money with small jobs in the neighbor hood when we were ~14. You are robbed by parts of your childhood but some stuff you can still catch up as an adult. It also helped us a lot in our job life because since young age we were able to take over responsibility.

I am so happy I have my brothers, we help each other a lot and we all have good jobs &amp; loving partners now.",,,t3_10m2qk1,r/AITA comment,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0.6,0,1,0,,0,0,0,1

This is obviously not quite the same, but hear me out. I'm Icelandic and have a very long and complicated name (in international groups on social media where I go by my actual name I've been clocked as an Icelander by name alone).
I usually go by a nickname I got as a baby, which is obviously a lot shorter, but it's still hard to pronounce by people who aren't Icelandic or have difficulties with R. There's an English version of it, so I go by that to people who aren't Icelandic or have difficulties with it (f.ex. exchange students at my university).
That's my choice; it's easier for them (I'm fine with any pronunciation of my name, but many find it very difficult) and it really helps when communicating on the Internet because most don't have easy access to the Icelandic letters in my name.

man-243,"And actually, the mother-racist-daughter-racist combo should be thanking OP … these same screen shots in five to seven years would ensure no college acceptances, and in ten years, no job at any company worth working for. At age nine maybe she can still take in the lesson that racism is ugly. 

Side note for your daughter: bullying can come from jealousy. Your daughter’s beauty is likely magnified not only by the mixing of two sets of genetics but by her personality. Obviously personality is more important, but it can’t hurt to emphasize that “blasian” features are widely considered extra gorgeous.",,t3_16c52uo,jzhksjb,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.2,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0

man-247,"I agree with this, and not because I think OP is wrong for wanting their partner to take safety classes (they’re not wrong). I just think presenting it as a gift is not the way to go. 

OP I appreciate your thought of getting the classes as a gift to try to assuage your partner’s ego, but I don’t see this coming off any other way than passive aggressive. He doesn’t sound like he’s being realistic about gun safety or his own capabilities, and as you said he thinks he’s got everything down so why would he need classes (from his POV)?

It’s not that I’m all that concerned about preserving his ego, it’s that I think gifting the classes may create more problems than solutions. What will you do if he simply doesn’t go? You’ll be back to square one with needing him to learn gun safety, and if you insist upon it then, I can almost guarantee the discussion will be derailed into “you bought me a gift that wasn’t actually a gift.”

Honestly in this scenario I think being up front about what you need him to do is absolutely warranted. He doesn’t need to be gently encouraged to take classes, he needs to understand that he is NOT a safe gun handler and if he’s going to own guns around you (or at all, tbh) he MUST learn proper handling and safety. The moment where he accidentally pointed it towards you was fraught with both of you freaking out, but now you can approach him calmly and firmly and tell him that for your own safety (as well as his and everyone else’s) he must learn proper gun handling from an expert. And if he’s simply not at all willing to admit that he mishandled the gun in that scenario you described… well, I wouldn’t be comfortable living with him, I’ll say that.",,t3_z75baa,iy4usea,,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0.2,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0
man-248,"My Dad has terminal cancer.  

I was planning on moving 300 miles away and move in with my partner. Instead, I moved in with my Dad.  My partner has been incredibly supportive of this.

I hope that he still has a good few years left.  My partner understands that I don't want to miss a single second of time with my Dad.  

Time is the most precious thing there is.

Losing a parent is... there are no words.  My Dad is my rock, my foundation.  Seeing his health decline is terrifying.  I'm so thankful to have such an understanding partner.

OP, your partner is facing her worst fears.  If you force her to stay she will likely never forgive you.

man-251,"Hello, thank your for your comment. I apologize if this response is not in the right format I don't have experience on this platform.

I want to sit down with Heather and explain the different options and let her choose.

Mel feels guilty (and to be honest I do too) that this is even a question here because so much money has gone to Ava's family. When the girls were younger we tried very hard to ensure things were equal, and reflecting back this is obviously bad planning on our part.

Mel wants to give Heather the money without explaining or exploring the options. This would significantly impact our lives now. Mel had mentioned the option about selling the land but now doesn't think we should and should still be able to give Heather the land and the down payment. To be frank, we just can't unless we make big sacrifices and changes in our plan going forward. That's what Mel thinks we should do.

You are right this is our doing and we have significant regrets over the lack of planning. I guess we just have different ideas of how to move forward and this argument is getting very heavy.

(For clarity, Mel is my wife)",,t3_yj6204,ium3l5y,,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,,0,0,0,1
