abstract = {Discharge against medical advice (AMA), in which a patient chooses to leave the hospital before the treating physician recommends discharge, continues to be a common and vexing problem. This article reviews the prevalence, costs, predictors, and potential interventions for this clinical problem. Between 1% and 2% of all medical admissions result in an AMA discharge. Predictors of AMA discharge, based primarily on retrospective cohort studies, tended to be younger age, Medicaid or no insurance, male sex, and current or a history of substance or alcohol abuse. Interventions to reduce the rate of AMA discharges have not been systematically studied. This article offers suggestions for interventions based on studies in other areas of clinical care as well as the psychiatric AMA discharge literature. Studies for this review were identified by searching the relevant MeSH heading (discharge) and key words (against medical advice, leave, elope, hospital, and self-discharge) in PubMed databases and selecting all English-language articles from 1970 through 2008 that included data on adult medical inpatients.}

abstract=""In recent years corpus linguistic tools have afforded language researchers and health practitioners a powerful method to learn about the linguistic character of health-related communication in a variety of contexts. This chapter charts recent developments in the burgeoning field of corpus-based health communication research and presents a series of studies which aptly illustrate the utility of corpus linguistic techniques for undertaking in-depth, quantitative and qualitative examinations of health-related language data. The overarching argument of this chapter is one in favour of the use of corpus linguistic techniques, which, we argue, are capable of providing revealing insights about how people conceptualize and discursively construct their subjective experiences and understandings of health and illness."",

Our analysis reveals the increasing growth in use of Reddit as a data source, the range of disciplines this research is occurring in, how researchers are getting access to Reddit data, the characteristics of the datasets researchers are using, the subreddits and topics being studied, the kinds of analysis and methods researchers are engaging in, and the emerging ethical questions of research in this space. We discuss how researchers need to consider the impact of Reddit’s algorithms, affordances, and generalizability of the scientific knowledge produced using Reddit data, as well as the potential ethical dimensions of research that draws data from subreddits with potentially sensitive populations. }

neimhin,"\cite{neviarouskaya-2010} developed a rule-based algorithm for recognizing attitude in terms of affect (negative and positive), judgement (negative and positive), and appreciation.
The algorithm systematically composes the classifications of constituent sentence parts, such that entire sentences can be classified. Their theory of attitude and the corresponding algorithm are applicable at three levels.
At the top level are just three classifications, positive, negative and neutral.
At the mid level, positive and negative classifications are further subdivided into, affect, judgement, and appreciation.
At the most fine-grained level affect is divided into interest, joy, and surprise (positive affect) and anger, disgust, fear, guilt, sadness, shame (negative affect).
The algorithm accounts for negation (by several means), amplification of sentiment, neutralisation of sentiment etc.
A corpus of human-annotated sentences is collected and compared to the results of the automated system.
The automated system was found to have greater agreement with the human annotations than a baseline system that simply selected the most intense token annotation.
\cite{neviarouskaya-2010} discuss some of the failures and failure modes of their system.
The accuracy of the automated systems (at predicting human annotations) is highest at the top level of the classification hierarchy (positive, negative, neutral), and the accuracy decreases as we move to finer grained classifications.",4,3.5,neimhin,"Recognition of affect, judgment, and appreciation in text.",neviarouskaya,2010,neviarouskaya-2010,"@inproceedings{neviarouskaya-2010,

neimhin,"Miller (2020) reports a survey of 628 Reddit users. The questionnaire covered Internet usage, Reddit usage (especially in relation to self-disclosure on subreddits), and a set of psychological questions relating to connectedness, sociol support perception, life satisfaction, narcissism, and sensation seeking.

The sharing of intimate information on Reddit's anonymous-feeling platform was found to be significantly correlated with the sensation seeking tendency, but there was no evidence of an association with narcissicism.

The findings are interpreted as evidence that intimate self-disclosure on Reddit is motivated by feeling disconnected and alone.

The research participants were approached with advertisements on Reddit, as well as with posts to related subreddits, e.g. `r/confessions`, `r/offmychest`.

Miller (2020) suggests that ""[f]uture work should investigate whether engagement is driven by empathetic concern, or whether it is spurred by boredom and the tendency of confessions to have a high degree of shock value"", which is an interesting line of investigation in the context of spontaneous online advice-seeking.

Forty articles from three different academic journals in computing research have been analysed; the results indicate that the IMRD (introduction-methods-results-discussion) pattern cannot be applied to research articles in computer science systematically. Introductory and concluding sections, however, are used in more instances. It is the central part of these articles which seems to depart more from the IMRD pattern. Detailed analyses of the structure of introductions, results, and conclusions are included, and relevant comparisons with previous studies are drawn.}

neimhin,"The authors describe the process by which the LIWC2015 dictionaries and word-categorisations were developed. It involved a significant manual process with collaboration of several judges to create an initial dictionary. The dictionary was then analysed and ammended to fix ommissions or internal inconsistencies. The set of categories was chosen based on attributes commonly study in social, health, and personality psychology. The authors give an explanation as to why the internal consistency of linguistic-based psychometrics can be lower or have wider margins than a questionnaire (it comes down to the fact that people rarely repeat themselves in spontaneous natural language, whereas questionnaires make heavy use of repetition, or at least rhyming). Perhaps of interest to our group's analysis is the claim that Spearman-Brown prediction formula is generally are more accurate approximation of a word-category's internal consistency than is Cronbach's alpha.",5,4.5,neimhin,The Development and Psychometric Properties of LIWC2015,pennebaker,2015,pennebaker-2015,"@techreport{pennebaker-2015,

n/a,"The authors find 101 known fraudulent 10-K filings, and 101 likely non-fraudulent 10-K filings, and use Agent99 Analyzer to extract features from the texts of the MD&A sections. Statistical and Machine Learning algorithms are found to classify the fraudulent and non-fraudulent filings more accurately than human judges typically perform in deception detection tasks. It is also found that the false positive and false negative rates are more balanced than for human judges, indicating less bias from the statistical and machine learning algorithms. The athors discuss a wide range of approaches to analysis and detection of deceipt, outlining the underlying assumptions of each approach. Some approaches focus more on the deceiver's intentional additions that are intended to deceive, whereas others focus on the unintentional 'leakage' of information arising from the deceivers attempt to deceive. The author's note that larger companies are likely to afford more resources to producing misleading or deceptive MD&As. The research study itself may serve fraudulent companies in adjusting their methods of deception. However, I believing forcing companies to dedicate more resources in order to successfully deceive is a societal good. It means that more people within the company will be privy to the deception, which increases the chance of whistleblowers stepping forward, and it simply increases the cost of deception, which disencentivises it. The linguistic/textual features extracted primarily use counts or ratios of word categories in the text as proxies for metalinguistic properties such as syntactic/lexical complexity, verbosity, imagery, deference, uncertainty.",,,carl,Identification of fraudulent financial statements using linguistic credibility analysis,humpherys,2011,humpherys-2011,"@article{humpherys-2011,

The Continuous Bag of Words model is trained to predict a missing word, given the word's context, and the Skip-Gram model is trained to predict the contextual words, given a central word. The properties of the extracted word-embeddings are tested on a novel test set, and it is shown that syntactic and semantic relationships between words have analogies to arithmetic operations of the vector representations in many cases. Vector representations of words based on Context Vectors had already been demonstrated, but the strong performance of the representations for both syntactic and semantic relationships was of note.

Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, we first construct and empirically validate a gold-standard list of lexical features (along with their associated sentiment intensity measures) which are specifically attuned to sentiment in microblog-like contexts. We then combine these lexical features with consideration for five general rules that embody grammatical and syntactical conventions for expressing and emphasizing sentiment intensity. Interestingly, using our parsimonious rule-based model to assess the sentiment of tweets, we find that VADER outperforms individual human raters (F1 Classification Accuracy = 0.96 and 0.84, respectively), and generalizes more favorably across contexts than any of our benchmarks. &lt;/p&gt; }, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media}, author={Hutto, C. and Gilbert, Eric}, year={2014}, month={May}, pages={216-225} }","rule-based, social media, VADER",https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/download/14550/14399/18068,

neimhin,"The researchers study advice-seeking behaviour on the Reddit subforums r/AmItheAsshole and r/relationships, which are text-heavy forums. They note that such forums have a tendency to reinforce cultural norms and moral behaviour. In our study we take an interest in the productivity and social cohesion visible in advice-seeking behaviour itself. The choices users make in advice-seeking and advice-giving may itself abide by cultural norms and moral behaviours reinforced by the forum. Our first approximation analysis does not account for this auto-regressive dynamic and thus leaves room for future work. The study by Cannon (2021) uses nearly 1000 posts from r/AmItheAsshole and r/relationships, all of which were posted in the same calendar month, and which organised by Reddit's internal algorithm using the query ""top"", which is a black-box algorithm from the perspective of researchers. One of the authors' research questions centres around engagement, but their sampling approach biases towards posts with higher engagement. The authors leverage some stylistic norms in the texts to extract demographic data about the individuals involved in users' self-disclosure stories, finding that about 65% of posts follow the stylistic norms in a manner amenable to automated data extraction with regular expressions. The study does not examine relationships between language use and productive/helpful conversations or animosity.",,,neimhin,“Don’t Downvote A$$$$$$s!!”: An Exploration of Reddit’s Advice Communities,cannon,2021,cannon-2021,"@article{cannon-2021,

abstract=""Emotions play an important role in interpersonal interactions and social conflict, yet their function in the development of controversy and disagreement in online conversations has not been fully explored. To address this gap, we study controversy on Reddit, a popular network of online discussion forums. We collect discussions from various topical forums and use emotion detection to recognize a range of emotions from text, including anger, fear, joy, admiration, etc. (Code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/ChenK7166/controversy-emotion). We find controversial comments express more anger and less admiration, joy, and optimism than non-controversial comments. Moreover, controversial comments affect emotions of downstream comments, resulting in a long-term increase in anger and a decrease in positive emotions. The magnitude and direction of emotional change differ by forum. Finally, we show that emotions help better predict which comments will become controversial. Understanding the dynamics of emotions in online discussions can help communities to manage conversations better."",
